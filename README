Step 1: run startup.m to add dependencies
Step 2: run demo/small_20plot.m to see an interesting toy example.
Step 3: run demo/demo_digits_sample.m to see the most sophisticated usage 
which include taking a subsample, building a knn graph, and running all
active learning strategies for 2 repetitions (EER has been commented out). 
Step 4: modify demo_digits_sample.m to create your own problem. (ref
